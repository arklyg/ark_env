# gabriel_env
Gabriel's personal favorite environment configurations, and settings, etc.

## Features
Some features are custom practices of my own.

### Vim configuration 
*  Some basic configurations, such as colorscheme, shift width, and using 4 spaces as a tab, etc.
*  Multitab management, including hotkeys of navigation between tabs and showing the file name only rather than the default representation of full file path which is mostly very long and is always omitted too much.
*  Added hotkey ```@``` which highlights all the same words where the cursor is in without the annoying feature that the cursor jumping to the next identical word as the default hotkey ```*``` does.

### Git abbreviations of args
*  Some of my own custom practices.

### Screen configuration
*  My costomized status bar.
